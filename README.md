## Design ðŸ”µ

### Colour Scheme ðŸ”¹

![geoMastermind WebbApp Colour Palette](assets/readme/colorPalette.png)

We wanted to choose colours that reflected the environment of the universum, so we have chosen a variety of Blue(<b>water</b>), Green(<b>nature</b>) and Yellow(<b>sun</b>) for our site.

This colors are going to be implemented as <b>60-30-10</b> rule with the base of the color #0E304F. We want to have a more dark theme on the website, along with the light colors.

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors website](https://coolors.co/aeffd8-8affc1-8fdc97-ac8887-9f4a54).

### Typography ðŸ”¹

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* "Lato" is used for headings and bigger content on the site. It is a sans serif typeface family.

![LatoBlack900](assets/readme/fontstyleBlack900Lato.png)

* "Nunito" is used for the body text, paragraphs which are the questions and answer. Nunito is a sans-serif typeface designed by Vernon Adams. It has a rounded, friendly and modern style, and its letterforms are clean and legible.

### Imagery ðŸ”¹

All the images displayed in this site was originelly downloaded by the sites below, and modified in Photoshop.

### Wireframes ðŸ”¹

![geoMastermind Web app Overview](assets/readme/wireframes/wireframeOverview.png)

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop. I used the webbapplication called [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/suu74na/psiivfn/r6B57) for creating the wireframes for webbapplication <b>geoMastermind</b>.

## Features ðŸ”µ


### Accessibility ðŸ”¹

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
* Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
* Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
* Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
